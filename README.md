### Datasets:
- yelp_academic_dataset_business.json: raw data downloaded from yelp official website. Please download the data from this link:: https://www.yelp.com/dataset. 
- yelp_academic_dataset_review.json: raw data downloaded from yelp official website. Please download the data from this link: https://www.yelp.com/dataset.
- df_labeled_test.csv: The whole 1,000,000 data with predicted labels using BERT. Please download the data from this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/10PcVCoBCnqxw4uqgUA45UfAvxuzkakqd/view?usp=sharing
- labeled_review_id.xlsx: manually labeled records of reviews. This dataset is the sample data for training and testing.

### Word2Vec_TFIDF_traditionalML_RNN
This folder contains code for using TF-IDF and Word2Vec to deal with text data. The subsequent steps involve applying traditional machine learning models ( Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Linear SGD Classifier, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVC), RNN (Recurrent Netural Network) model and model evaluation.

### Multilabel classification using BERT
This folder contains code for training a text multilabel classification model using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). The model is designed to classify Yelp reviews into five categories: 'food_quality', 'environment', 'service', 'convenience', 'cost_effectiveness'.

### EDA_cluster_time_series
This folder used the result predicted from BERT. The codes involve time series analysis on review text and numerical factors, data visualization on how the pandemic affected restaurantsâ€™ performances and customer demand in five dimensions.
